## Introduction

This repository includes a collection of programs developed as part of the PSAP course for first-year students. These programs cover a variety of problem-solving techniques and programming concepts that were taught throughout the semester.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── Program1
│   ├── main.c
│   └── README.md
├── Program2
│   ├── main.c
│   └── README.md
├── Program3
│   ├── main.c
│   └── README.md
├── ...
└── README.md
```

Each program is contained within its own directory and includes the source code file (`main.c`) and a README file (`README.md`) that provides details specific to that program.
